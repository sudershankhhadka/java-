-->Used for memory management

--->   object + .   == instance
---->  Class + .   == static

--->Static variables can be changed values


instance  methods cannot be  directly called in the main method because main method is static

they should be called by creating objects    or   the methods, variables should be declared static




static has higher scope than instance variables
