-->process of hiding implementation details in a program
--> To achieve abstraction
        a> Abstract Class
            class which contains abstract(unimplemented) methods and non-abstract(implemented) methods is known as abstract class.

                ==>Abstract Method: method which does not have body or implementation
                  eg:
                   abstract  void add();
                   abstract void print(String message);

                ==>Every abstract class must have at least one child class and child class must override abstract methods.
                ==> We cannot create object of abstract class.
                ==>Level of abstraction = 0-100;

                abstract class class_name{
                //contains abstract and non-abstract methods.
                }

        b> Interface
            -->Same as class which contains public abstract methods and public static final variables is interface.
            -->Every interface must have atleast one implementation class and implemented class must override abstract methods.
            --> We cant create object of interface.
            -->100% abstraction


            syntax;
                interface interface_name{
                    //public static final variables
                    //public abstract methods
                }







                always extend class before inheriting interfaces.
